I’m a **PhD candidate** in Statistics at the [University of Texas at Austin—McCombs School of Business](https://www.mccombs.utexas.edu/). My research focuses on developing and applying **Bayesian Machine Learning** methods to time‑series problems, finance, and macroeconomics.

I am supervised by [Carlos M. Carvalho](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=zEFW3rUAAAAJ&hl=en) and [James Scott](https://jgscott.github.io/), and co‑advised by [Hedibert F. Lopes](https://hedibert.org/).
